## A Collaborative Approach

(I'm not gonna lie. I thought about coming up here and talking about how, when I was in the hospital right here in Raleigh NC in 2016, on death's door with a mysterious illness, and none of you visited me, that i planned my revenge-- to crush you in historic proportions. All of that is true, except for the bitterness. I was happy to be alive then, and I'm happy to be with you today.

so this will not be a time to gloat. not today. this wasn't my championship. this was our championship. each one of you allowed me to defeat you at least once in 2018; Billy, one of my oldest friends, gave me the pleasure of defeating him twice by a total of 53 points; Aaron and VZ even allowed me to beat them thrice, by 67 and 79 points respectively (but who's counting). You truly do embody the apostle Paul's exhortation to "outdo one another in showing honor".

we've all had some of these players on our teams. this will be a time to celebrate us; to celebrate our players; and to laugh together. i hope that each of you will see that your greatest joy is not in individual triumph, but in working together towards one goal: to see Jerry's Belt Buckle repeat as champion in 2019)

## Celebrating our players

(next, let's celebrate our players. When you see a guy, i think it will be interesting, by a show of hands, to see how much we have a shared history with these guys (and how ridiculous this all really is). We're also going to play a game of "Caption this" for each image.)
